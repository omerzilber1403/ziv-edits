# 🚀 Netlify Deployment - Fixed Instructions

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The issue was that Netlify was looking in the wrong directory. Now it's configured correctly.

## 📦 New Files Ready:

1. **`ziv-portfolio-netlify-fixed.zip`** - Updated build with correct config
2. **`netlify.toml`** - Fixed to point to `out` directory

## 🌐 Deploy to Netlify:

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/Login
3. Drag `ziv-portfolio-netlify-fixed.zip` to the deploy area
4. **Your site will be live!**

### Method 2: Manual Upload
1. Extract `ziv-portfolio-netlify-fixed.zip`
2. Upload the contents of the `out` folder to Netlify
3. Set publish directory to `out` (if asked)

## 🔧 Netlify Settings (if needed):

- **Publish directory**: `out`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Node version**: 18

## ✅ What's Fixed:

- ✅ Correct publish directory (`out` instead of `.next`)
